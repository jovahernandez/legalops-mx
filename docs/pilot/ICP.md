# Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) — Pilot v1

## Primary Wedge: Immigration Law (US)

We start narrow: **small immigration firms (1-5 attorneys) in the US** that handle
removal defense, asylum, family petitions, and VAWA cases.

## Why Immigration First?

1. **High urgency** — court dates create natural deadlines (reduces "nice to have" objection)
2. **Document-heavy** — average case needs 15-25 documents; completeness tracking is a clear win
3. **Underserved** — most immigration firms use generic tools, not immigration-specific workflows
4. **Bilingual requirement** — our Spanish/English support is a differentiator
5. **Clear funnel** — intake → qualification → doc collection → case packet → filing
6. **Measurable ROI** — time saved per intake is easy to quantify (see ROIModel.md)

---

## Disqualifying Signals (Anti-ICP)

- Firms with >10 attorneys (too complex, long sales cycle)
- Firms that only do business immigration (H-1B mills have different workflows)
- Firms already deeply invested in INSZoom/Docketwise (switching cost too high for pilot)
- Solo attorneys who handle <10 cases/month (not enough volume to see ROI)
