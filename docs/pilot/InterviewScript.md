# Pilot Interview Script — 10 Questions

## Context

Use this script during **Day 10** of the pilot (or whenever you conduct a deep-dive
with a pilot firm). Schedule 30 minutes. Record with permission.

**Goal:** Understand if the product solves a real problem well enough to charge for it.

## Before You Start

> "Thank you for being part of our pilot. This conversation helps us build something
> truly useful for immigration practitioners. There are no right or wrong answers —
> honest feedback, including negative feedback, is the most valuable thing you can
> give us. Everything you share stays confidential."

---

## The 10 Questions

### 1. Workflow Before Us
> "Walk me through how you handled a new immigration intake **before** using our system.
> From first client contact to opening the matter — every step."

**Listen for:** manual steps, tools used, pain points, time estimates.

---

### 2. First Impression
> "Think back to your first day using the platform. What was your initial reaction?
> Was anything confusing or surprisingly easy?"

**Listen for:** onboarding friction, "aha moments", confusion points.

---

### 3. Daily Usage
> "How are you using the system on a typical day now? Which features do you open first?"

**Listen for:** pipeline (Kanban) usage, doc tracking, approvals. What they DON'T mention is equally important.

---

### 4. Time Savings
> "Can you estimate how much time the system saves you per intake compared to before?
> Per week overall?"

**Listen for:** specific numbers ("saves me 30 min per case"), vague ("a little"),
or none ("honestly, about the same"). Document exact quotes.

---

### 5. Document Completeness
> "Has the document checklist and completeness tracking changed how quickly you
> collect client documents? How?"

**Listen for:** whether clients respond faster, whether the checklist catches missing items they'd normally forget.

---

### 6. Approval Workflow
> "How has the approval/review process worked for you? Do the SLA reminders help
> or feel annoying?"

**Listen for:** bottleneck identification, whether nudges are helpful or noise, attorney vs. paralegal perspective.

---

### 7. B2C Prep Kit (if applicable)
> "Have any clients come through the Prep Kit? If so, were they better prepared
> than typical walk-in or phone intakes?"

**Listen for:** lead quality, prep level, whether the firm sees B2C channel as valuable.

---

### 8. Biggest Friction
> "What's the most frustrating thing about the platform right now?
> If you could fix ONE thing, what would it be?"

**Listen for:** the single biggest blocker. This is your #1 priority fix.

---

### 9. Missing Feature
> "Is there something you expected the system to do that it doesn't?
> What would make you use it for 100% of your cases?"

**Listen for:** integration needs (court calendars, USCIS status), missing document types, workflow gaps.

---

### 10. Willingness to Pay
> "If we continue improving based on your feedback, would this be something
> your firm would pay for? What would feel like a fair monthly price?"

**Listen for:** price anchors, comparison to current tools, enthusiasm level.
**Key signal:** Do they ask about pricing BEFORE you bring it up? (strongest signal)

---

## After the Interview

1. **Immediately** write down your top 3 takeaways while fresh
2. Score the firm 1-5 on:
   - Engagement (how much they used the system)
   - Satisfaction (how happy they are with it)
   - Willingness to pay (how likely they are to become a customer)
3. Add friction points to your product backlog
4. Share summary with the team within 24 hours

## Red Flags to Watch For

- "I keep forgetting to log in" → activation problem
- "My paralegal doesn't like it" → UX problem for key user
- "It's nice but I still use my spreadsheet for X" → core workflow not captured
- "I'd use it if it had [giant feature]" → scope creep signal, dig into WHY
- Long pauses after Question 10 → not convinced on value
